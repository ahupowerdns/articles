Ahhh..  meetings.  The one old school company thing that survives in this
agile, open-office, 'remote first', nomadic worker world.  And it is easy to
see why: the 'meeting' is the last guaranteed way to get everyone to pay
attention for an hour, or at least, pretend to.  It still is rare for people
to fake attending two meetings at the same time in any case.

The late great [Andrew S. Grove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Grove), long time CEO of Intel
and overall hero engineer, wrote the massively important book [High Output
Management](https://a16z.com/2015/11/13/high-output-management/).  The best
advice I can give you is to stop reading this page right now and read that
book instead.  If you are short on time, you can find here my slightly
modernized version of chapter 4 "Meetings".

So - the Meeting.  It consumes lots of people and lots of time.  Even
conservatively measured, a typical meeting easily costs in excess of 1000
euros (or the local purchasing power equivalent), but can be called by any
office rando, without any kind of oversight.  You'd have a harder time
ordering new pencils in many organizations than blowing $1500 on a 10 person
meeting!

Many meeting requests I get these days consist of nothing more than a title,
a time and dial-in details.  In the olden days, you would never have gotten
away with that since even calling a meeting was a lot of work, so no one
would do that without carefully laying out what the meeting was about.

Because we have so many alternatives to meetings we like better (like duking
it out on instant messaging or over email), we can safely assume that if a
meeting gets called, a difficult choice needs to be made.  Let's say 7 people
are expected to attend.  Two of these are intimately aware of the problem,
three have heard of it and another two are invited for their expertise, but
have not previously been involved.

Without any pre-meeting preparation, we start off with the two problem owners
taking 20 minutes to synchronously explain the issue to the 5 others. The
result:

 * Three of those will hear more than they need
 * Two of them won't hear enough
 * *We're at 1/3rd of the useful attention span of the modern employee
   already*

What happens next is worse.  Part of the audience is now very well informed
but our invited experts are still chewing on this new problem.  Yet the
focus of the meeting is to draw conclusions and make decisions.  And now
that the situation has been explained, this is what we'll start doing!

Underinformed low quality decisions are the result.  On top of this, because
no one had a clear idea what the meeting was about, some people may be
attending it needlessly, and more useful people may not have been
invited at all. 

The alternative is clear.  Instead of spending 7 person hours together on
the event, have the people calling the meeting actually send out an agenda
**well in advance** that states:

 * What the problem is, in some detail
 * What things have been considered already and their relative merits
 * What conclusion we hope to get out of the meeting

This takes, say, 30 minutes extra for the convener of the meeting, and an
aggregate of two hours of reading maybe for the rest. 

The net result:
 
 * The meeting starts at a far more level playing field
 * Some of the folks invited may decide the meeting is not for them & spend their time
   more usefully
 * Other people could however now be asked to join since based on the agenda
 someone realized this is their thing
 * The very act of writing out the problem may have clarified it, a form of
 [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)

There is nothing but win here.  Finally, a successful meeting is best
wrapped up with some notes shared quickly, perhaps also with people that
could not make it but might still have insights.

Now, in some organizations I am told people "don't read agendas and won't
prepare anyhow".  This is likely true, but if this is the case you have
bigger problems that can't be solved by a single blog post.  And even then
the exercise of writing an agenda is helpful, even if only for yourself.

Good luck & I sincerely hope you make the most of your meetings.
